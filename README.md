📌 Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Using Python & AWS Comprehend

🔍 Overview
In the age of social media, brands, governments, and organizations struggle to understand public sentiment in real-time. This project uses Python and AWS Comprehend to analyze social media comments, classify sentiment, and extract insights from large-scale user discussions.

While this project showcases a sneaker brand launch as a use case because I read Shoe Dog recently , the same techniques can be applied to:

Public sentiment toward government policies (e.g., climate change legislation).
Consumer reactions to product launches (e.g., new iPhones, Tesla models).
Market sentiment analysis (e.g., stock price predictions based on Twitter data).
Geopolitical tensions & diplomatic relations (e.g., U.S.-China relations).
By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and data visualization, this project helps organizations make data-driven decisions.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python – Data collection, processing, and analysis.
AWS Comprehend – Machine learning-based sentiment analysis.
Instaloader – Scraping social media data from Instagram.
Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization.
Boto3 – AWS SDK for Python to interact with AWS Comprehend.
📌 Features

✅ Scrape Social Media Data – Extract comments, hashtags, and engagement metrics.
✅ Perform Sentiment Analysis – Classify text as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed using AWS Comprehend.
✅ Visualize Sentiment Trends – Generate insights on how sentiment changes over time.
✅ Compare Content Performance – Analyze engagement differences between post types (Reels, images, videos).
✅ Adaptable to Any Use Case – Works for politics, finance, tech trends, or social issues beyond sneaker brands.

🚀 How It Works

1️⃣ Scraping Social Media Data
We use Instaloader to extract comments from Instagram posts. This step can be replaced with Twitter, YouTube, or Reddit for different applications.

2️⃣ Sentiment Analysis with AWS Comprehend
AWS Comprehend allows us to classify text sentiment using pre-trained NLP models.


3️⃣ Data Visualization
Using Seaborn and Matplotlib, we can visualize trends and insights.

📊 Use Cases Beyond Sneakers

Use Case	Potential Insights
Government Climate Policies	Public support or opposition to new climate laws
Tech Product Launches	Consumer reactions to new iPhones, Tesla models, AI tools
Financial Market Sentiment	Predict stock movements based on social media chatter
U.S.-China Relations	Measure global sentiment on diplomatic events
Movie & TV Show Releases	Audience reception on Twitter, YouTube comments
💡 Results & Business Impact

Real-time feedback: Helps brands adapt marketing strategies instantly.
